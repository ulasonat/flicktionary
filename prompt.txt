Your task is to act as an expert linguist and cultural analyst. I will provide you with a full transcript of movie subtitles. You must perform a comprehensive analysis of this entire transcript to identify and explain all language elements that would be difficult for a proficient (C1-level) non-native English speaker, particularly one whose native language is Turkish, to understand.  

  The primary goal is to filter out extremely common idioms and focus only on the more obscure, nuanced, and non-literal language that would challenge even an advanced speaker.  

  You MUST extract EVERY relevant term from the following categories



  Opaque Idiomatic Expressions: Phrases where the meaning is not literal and difficult to guess (e.g., "you're a brick").  

  Less Common Phrasal Verbs: Verb + preposition/adverb combinations with non-obvious meanings (e.g., "reign in").  

  Colloquialisms & Slang: Informal, conversational, or culturally-specific language that isn't taught in standard textbooks (e.g., "made him a week ago").  

  Metaphorical Language: Words or phrases used in a non-literal, figurative way (e.g., "a moral gray area").  

  Truly Uncommon Vocabulary: Single words at a C2-level or specialized jargon (e.g., emasculate, retainer).  

  Culturally-Specific References: Names or terms requiring specific cultural knowledge (e.g., "Venmo").  



Output Format: Strict JSON

Your final output must be a single, raw JSON object. This means your entire response will start with [ and end with ]. There should be absolutely no explanatory text, headings, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON content.

The root of the JSON object must be an array, where each element is an object representing a single identified linguistic term.

Each object in the array must conform to the following schema:



[

  {

    "term": "string",

    "beginTimestamp": "string",

    "endTimestamp": "string",

    "englishMeaning": "string",

    "turkishMeaning": "string",

    "sampleSentenceInEnglish": "string",

    "sampleSentenceInTurkish": "string"

  }

]



Field Definitions:



term: The exact word, expression, or idiom from the transcript.

beginTimestamp: The start timestamp of the subtitle line where the term appears (e.g., "00:15:22,140").

endTimestamp: The end timestamp of the subtitle line where the term appears (e.g., "00:15:24,300").

englishMeaning: A clear and concise definition in English, specific to the term's context in the movie.

turkishMeaning: The closest and most accurate translation or functional equivalent in Turkish.

sampleSentenceInEnglish: The full, verbatim sentence from the transcript in which the term is used.

sampleSentenceInTurkish: A natural-sounding Turkish translation of the full sample sentence.

  

Guiding Principles:  



  Be Selective but Quite Comprehensive: Analyze the entire text, but only pull out items that meet the higher difficulty standard.  

  Exclusion Criteria: Crucially, you must OMIT very common, everyday idioms that a B2/C1 level student would likely already know. The purpose is to create a high-signal list, not a dictionary of every idiom.  

  Examples to EXCLUDE: make yourself at home, crossed my mind. 

  Examples to INCLUDE: you're a brick, get the itch, knockin' me sideways, play the keys.  

  Prioritize Opacity: Your priority should be on language that is non-literal, culturally dense, or colloquial. The most valuable findings will be the idioms and slang that are impossible to guess from their component words, as well as less known vocabulary words.

  Single Response: The final output must be a single JSON, comprehensive of every single word that meets the criteria.
